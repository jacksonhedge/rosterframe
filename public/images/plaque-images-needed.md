## Image Specifications

### Dimensions
- 4 cards: 1200x600 pixels
- 5 cards: 1200x700 pixels
- 6 cards: 1200x700 pixels
- 7 cards: 1200x800 pixels
- 8 cards: 1200x900 pixels
- 9 cards: 1200x900 pixels
- 10 cards: 1400x900 pixels

### Design Guidelines
1. Maintain consistent material appearance across all sizes
2. Card slots should be clearly defined with subtle shadows/indentations
3. Include mounting holes or hardware details for realism
4. Ensure proper spacing between card slots based on layout configurations
5. For Clear Plaque: transparent/glass effect with subtle reflections
6. For Dark Maple Wood: rich wood grain texture
7. For Black Marble: elegant marble veining pattern

### Card Slot Layouts
Refer to `/plaque-layouts-visual.md` for exact positioning of card slots in each configuration.

## Current Status
- Using existing 8-slot images as placeholders for all configurations
- Admin Preview Maker is fully functional and will use correct images once created
- The `preview-maker.ts` library already has correct positioning data for all layouts
